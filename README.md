**Problem Statement**
RSVP Movies is an Indian film production company which has produced many super-hit movies. They have usually released movies for the Indian audience but for their next project, they are planning to release a movie for the global audience in 2022.

The production company wants to plan their every move analytically based on data and have approached you for help with this new project. To ensure the success of this project, they have turned to data analytics. As a data analyst and SQL expert, I have been entrusted with the task of analyzing the movie data from the past three years and providing valuable insights to guide RSVP Movies in their strategic decisions.

**Segmented Analysis:**
To achieve this goal, our analytical journey is divided into four segments, each targeting specific aspects of the dataset to derive meaningful insights. These insights will inform RSVP Movies’ decisions and ensure a data-driven approach to their new global project.

1. **Understanding the Data**:
We begin by comprehending the dataset’s structure and content. Familiarity with the data is crucial before embarking on any analysis. This segment helps us get acquainted with what each column represents.

2. **Box Office Performance Analysis**:

To gauge the past success of movies, we delve into box office performance, focusing on revenue, budget, and profit. Through SQL queries, we determine the average budget, identify the top revenue-generating movies, and calculate the total profit for movies released in the past three years.

3. **Genre Insights**:

Understanding the popularity of movie genres is essential. We analyze the dataset to find the most popular movie genre in the past three years based on the number of movies in each genre.

4. **Audience Rating Assessment**:

To cater effectively to a global audience, we scrutinize audience preferences. We calculate the average audience rating from 2017 -2019 movies, identify the top-rated movies in between this period, and explore the relationship between a movie’s collection and its audience rating.
